<h1>The Best Medias According To Myself</h1>
<h2>My Top Favourite Medias Of All Time (So Far)</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Interestellar</h3>
<p>This movie is just perfect. It brings themes like outer space's exploration, physical theories, human dilemmas, etc. Absolute Cinema.</p>
<h3>Dexter</h3>
<p>This serie brings as main character a serial killer who kills other serial killers. It is incredible because it shows how a psychosocial's mind works. Another Absolute Cinema.</p>
<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>This anime tells the story of a student that finds a notebook that has the power of killing people, and he uses it to eliminate all of the criminals of the world. It is an gorgeous anime, since it makes we reflect concepts like forgiveness, life's value, punition and justice. For sure, Absolute Cinema.</p>
<h3>Devil May Cry</h3>
<p>In this game series, you control Dante Sparda, a half-human, half-demon, that protects the world against the demons. This game is very captivating, because it dealswith themes, like identity, anger, violence, moral, and family issues (and it has a banger OST!). Once again, Absolute Cinema</p>
<h3>Ace Attorney</h3>
<p>This game series tells the trials and tribulations of some icoic characters of the game, like Phenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth. This one is very special to me, because it was one of the motivations that made me want to be a prosecutor. It deals with loyalty, moral, right x wrong, debates, and investigantions. Without a shadow of a doubt, Absolute Cinema</p>
